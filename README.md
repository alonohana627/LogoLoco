# LogoLoco - A Logger Toy Project in C++

## Background (you can skip it)

I have a repo called `erdo` where I practiced on C++. Anyway, I discovered that a Logger is a damn cool project idea.
Log rotation, different sinks, a little bit of Metaprogramming and templates, using concepts and traits - all of these
are possible in the amazing great world of Logging in C++!
